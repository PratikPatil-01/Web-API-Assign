    "APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau's software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone."

    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "    Efficiency: When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution. Adaptability: One of the greatest benefits of APIs is the ability it has to adapt to changes through data migration and flexibility of services.\n",
    "DISADVANTAGES:\n",
    "    As a single point of entry, an API is a gateway and can become a hacker's primary target. Once the API is compromised, all other applications and systems become vulnerable."
